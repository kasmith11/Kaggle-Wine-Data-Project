# KaggleWineDataProject

This Project utilizes textblob's polarity and subjectivity scores along with other characteristics of a wine in order to predict the wine's rating (or referred to as points the dataset points). The two models used in this code are Scikit-learns DecisionTreeRegressor and RandomForestRegressor. Links to the documentation for both of those packages can be found inside of the code.

Documentation for the data used in this project can be found at the following link: https://www.kaggle.com/zynicide/wine-reviews.
